Due to the seperation of front and back end proper installation commands can brick your files.

Here is how to open the front-end of the application WITHOUT bricking anything according to current design of application. 

This will be updated if running the application changes in the future.

1. From the root directory navigate to the frontend folder: 
 ```bash
    cd frontend
   ```

2.  If you haven't already done so, install node package manager: 
 ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the application using expo: 
 ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```
